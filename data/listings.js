The mountains were everywhere, the air was cool, and it was so quiet you could hear yourself think. So we stayed. We put up a bamboo house, connected water and electricity, brought in a bed and a table. Mornings here, the mist rolls in and sits low on the slope. At night the breeze is cool, the air is fresh, and everything is shady and windy. We used to picture small cottages tucked into the hillside, a yoga shala, an open-space kubo for meditation, a garden with coffee and cacao.

    "story": "This 3-level house sits inside White Hills Subdivision in Banawa — one of Cebu City's most established and well-connected residential areas. From the moment you step inside, you feel the warmth. The entrance has a wooden console table, a large mirror, and a staircase with wood and metal railings. The design throughout is earthy and intentional — rattan furniture, wooden cabinets, potted plants, and warm lighting.\n\nThe ground floor is where daily life happens — a master's bedroom, guest room, walk-in closet, and a common CR. The kitchen and dining area flow into the sala, with a bamboo divider separating the TV area from the dining table. Everything feels cozy and lived-in.\n\nThe 2nd floor opens up with a bedroom, CR, and a large space that works as a second living area or home office. From here you get a city view — you can see the skyline from the windows. The 3rd floor is where the income is — 3 boarding house units already set up for tenants. That's passive income built right into the house.\n\nEvery floor has a fire exit. Outside there's a dirty kitchen, wash area, and a helper's room. The lot is 200 sqm with parking for 2 cars.\n\nNindot kaayo ang location sa Banawa — duol sa downtown, sa malls, sa eskwelahan, ug sa hospital. Established na ang subdivision, hilom ug safe. Kung gusto nimo og balay nga pwede puy-an ug pwede pa mag-income, kani gyud.\n\nBank financing available. P13M nett.",
