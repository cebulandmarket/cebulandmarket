    "description": "When we first walked this land, we weren't looking to buy anything. We just ended up here. The mountains were everywhere, the air was cool, and it was so quiet you could hear yourself think. So we stayed. We put up a bamboo house, connected water and electricity, brought in a bed and a table. Mornings here, the mist rolls in and sits low on the slope. At night the breeze is cool, the air is fresh, and everything is shady and windy. We used to picture small cottages tucked into the hillside, a yoga shala, an open-space kubo for meditation, a garden with coffee and cacao. The slope is perfect for it — every level would have its own view. Private road access, 2 minutes to the main highway. We're moving abroad now, so this vision needs someone new. We'd rather it go to someone who gets it.",

    "story": "When we first walked this land, we weren't looking to buy anything. We just ended up here. The mountains were everywhere, the air was cool, and it was so quiet you could hear yourself think. We sat down and didn't want to leave.\n\nSo we stayed. We put up a bamboo house, connected water and electricity, brought in a bed and a table. Mornings here, the mist rolls in and sits low on the slope. You hear birds, nothing else. At night the breeze is cool, the air is fresh, and everything is shady and windy. It's that kind of place.\n\nWe used to sit outside and picture what this place could be. Small cottages tucked into the hillside. A garden with coffee and cacao. A place where people come to slow down — not a big resort, just something honest and peaceful. The slope is actually perfect for it. Every level would have its own view.\n\nLahi ra gyud ang feeling diri. Dili ma-explain — kinahanglan nimo ma-feel sa imong kaugalingon. Ang hangin, ang kahilom, ang view — murag gitagana gyud ni nga lugar para sa tawo nga makahibalo ug tinuod nga kalinaw.\n\nWe're moving abroad now, so this vision needs someone new. We're sharing it here because we'd rather it go to someone who gets it — someone who looks at this land and sees what we see. Basin ikaw na ang para ani nga lugar.",
    "vision_items": "A Quiet Mountain Retreat|Small cottages along the slope, each one with its own view. Somewhere people come to rest, not to be entertained. The terrain was made for this.|A Yoga Shala & Meditation Space|An open-air yoga shala on the hillside, an open-space kubo for meditation. Cool breeze, fresh mountain air, nothing but nature around you. This is the kind of place people travel far to find.|A Small Farm|Coffee, cacao, vegetables — the soil is good, the water is connected, and the weather up here is cooler than the lowlands. We started planting a few things ourselves.|A Place to Build a Life|1.5 hectares is a lot of space. A house here, a garden there, room for family. It's the kind of land you can grow into over years.|Livestock Farming|The land is spacious, sloping, and has water and electricity connected — ideal for raising goats, chickens, or cattle. The cooler climate up here is better for animals, and the natural vegetation keeps feed costs low.|Glamping &amp; Eco-Tourism|Set up glamping tents or treehouses along the hillside. Each spot gets its own mountain view. With nature tourism booming in Cebu, this location — quiet, cool, and minutes from the highway — is a natural fit.|Off-Grid Homestead|Build a self-sustaining homestead with solar panels, rainwater collection, and your own food garden. The water and electricity are already connected, and the cool mountain air makes this the perfect escape from city life."
