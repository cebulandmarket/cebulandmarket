    "description": "When we first walked this land, we weren't looking to buy anything. We just ended up here. The mountains were everywhere, the air was cool, and it was so quiet you could hear yourself think. So we stayed. We put up a bamboo house, connected water and electricity, brought in a bed and a table. Mornings here, the mist rolls in and sits low on the slope. At night the breeze is cool, the air is fresh, and everything is shady and windy. We used to picture small cottages tucked into the hillside, a yoga shala, an open-space kubo for meditation, a garden with coffee and cacao. The slope is perfect for it — every level would have its own view. Private road access, 2 minutes to the main highway. We're moving abroad now, so this vision needs someone new. We'd rather it go to someone who gets it.",

    "vision_items": "A Quiet Mountain Retreat|Small cottages along the slope, each one with its own view. Somewhere people come to rest, not to be entertained. The terrain was made for this.|A Yoga Shala & Meditation Space|An open-air yoga shala on the hillside, an open-space kubo for meditation. Cool breeze, fresh mountain air, nothing but nature around you. This is the kind of place people travel far to find.|A Small Farm|Coffee, cacao, vegetables — the soil is good, the water is connected, and the weather up here is cooler than the lowlands. We started planting a few things ourselves.|A Place to Build a Life|1.5 hectares is a lot of space. A house here, a garden there, room for family. It's the kind of land you can grow into over years.|Livestock Farming|The land is spacious, sloping, and has water and electricity connected — ideal for raising goats, chickens, or cattle. The cooler climate up here is better for animals, and the natural vegetation keeps feed costs low.|Glamping &amp; Eco-Tourism|Set up glamping tents or treehouses along the hillside. Each spot gets its own mountain view. With nature tourism booming in Cebu, this location — quiet, cool, and minutes from the highway — is a natural fit.|Off-Grid Homestead|Build a self-sustaining homestead with solar panels, rainwater collection, and your own food garden. The water and electricity are already connected, and the cool mountain air makes this the perfect escape from city life."

    "story": "Holy Family Village 2 is a gated subdivision with 24/7 security, concrete perimeter walls, tree-lined streets, and a swimming pool. Inside, it's quiet. You hear birds in the morning, not traffic. Kids play in the street because there's nowhere safer. But walk out the gate and everything changes — you're in the middle of one of Cebu City's most complete neighborhoods.\n\nBanilad Town Centre is a 3-minute walk. Vicente Gullas Memorial Hospital — 180 meters. University of the Visayas — 130 meters. A.S. Fortuna Street has everything on one strip: restaurants, banks, pharmacies, hardware stores, salons, gyms. Ayala Center Cebu is a short drive. IT Park — 5 minutes. The airport — 15 to 20 minutes. You don't need to go far for anything, ever.\n\nThe house is a cozy 2-storey — 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2-car parking, 100 sqm floor area on an 85 sqm lot. We furnished everything. Beds, tables, appliances — it's all here. You literally just bring your clothes and move in.\n\nWe ran it as an Airbnb for 8 months and it did really well — perfect 5.0 rating, 7 reviews, all five stars across cleanliness, accuracy, check-in, and communication. Guests kept mentioning the indoor spaces, comfort, and hospitality. We only took it off Airbnb because we switched to a long-term tenant — currently rented at ₱50,000/month. So whether you want to live here full-time or earn from it, this house is proven and ready.\n\nBanilad is where families, professionals, and expats settle when they want real city convenience without sacrificing peace. The streets are calm, the neighbors are friendly, and the location just makes life easier.\n\nAng nindot gyud diri — dili ka kinahanglan mopili between convenience ug kalinaw. Naa ra tanan. Hilom sa sulod, duol ang tanan sa gawas. Mao ni ang klase nga lugar nga mopahulay ka pagpauli, dili ma-stress.\n\nWe're moving abroad, so someone new gets to call this home. If you want a peaceful life in the heart of the city — this is it.",
