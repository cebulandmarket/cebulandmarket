<h1>SELLER LISTING AGREEMENT</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Property Listing Platform Service Agreement</p>

<p class="effective-date">Date: <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This Seller Listing Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between:</p>

<p><strong>CebuLandMarket</strong>, an online property listing platform operating at cebulandmarket.com (hereinafter referred to as the "Platform")</p>

<p>— and —</p>

<p><strong>Seller Name:</strong> <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Contact Number:</strong> <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Email Address:</strong> <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Property Location:</strong> <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Property Title/Tax Dec No.:</strong> <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>(hereinafter referred to as the "Seller")</p>

<h2>1. PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The Seller wishes to list their property on the Platform for the purpose of finding potential buyers. The Platform agrees to publish and promote the property listing in exchange for the fees outlined in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>2. LISTING FEE</h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>A non-refundable listing fee of <strong>One Hundred Pesos (₱100.00)</strong> shall be paid by the Seller via GCash to <strong>CebuLandMarket</strong> upon submission of the listing. The GCash number will be provided upon confirmation of listing submission.</li>
  <li>The listing fee covers the cost of publishing, maintaining, and promoting the property on the Platform.</li>
  <li>If the property listing does not pass the Platform's document verification process, the ₱100.00 listing fee shall be <strong>fully refunded</strong>.</li>
  <li>The listing shall remain active on the Platform until the property is sold, unless the Seller requests removal.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. PLATFORM FEE (1%)</h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Platform shall add a <strong>one percent (1%) service fee</strong> on top of the Seller's asking price. This adjusted amount shall be the final listing price displayed to buyers on the Platform.</li>
  <li>The Seller's asking price remains unchanged. The 1% is added on top — there is no deduction from the Seller's desired amount.</li>
  <li><strong>Upon successful sale of the property</strong>, the Seller agrees to remit the 1% platform fee to CebuLandMarket via GCash within <strong>seven (7) calendar days</strong> from the date of closing or receipt of payment from the buyer.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Example computation:</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top:6px;">
      <li>Seller's asking price: ₱1,000,000</li>
      <li>1% platform fee: ₱10,000</li>
      <li>Listing price shown to buyers: ₱1,010,000</li>
      <li>Seller receives: ₱1,000,000 (their full asking price)</li>
      <li>CebuLandMarket receives: ₱10,000 (1% platform fee)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The 1% fee shall be computed based on the <strong>final actual sale price</strong>. If the property is sold at a different price than listed (e.g., after negotiation), the 1% shall be based on the actual transaction amount.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. PAYMENT OF PLATFORM FEE</h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The 1% platform fee shall be remitted via <strong>GCash</strong> to:
    <ul style="margin-top:6px;">

      <li>The GCash number will be provided by CebuLandMarket upon confirmation of sale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Seller shall send proof of payment (screenshot of GCash transaction) to <strong>info@cebulandmarket.com</strong>.</li>
  <li>Payment is due within <strong>seven (7) calendar days</strong> from the date of closing or receipt of buyer's payment, whichever comes first.</li>

<h2>6. PLATFORM'S RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>

  <li>The Platform reserves the right to remove any listing that violates these terms or contains false information.</li>
  <li>If the property is sold while the listing is active, the 1% platform fee obligation remains in effect regardless of whether the listing is subsequently removed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>8. NON-CIRCUMVENTION</h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Seller agrees not to circumvent the Platform by directing buyers introduced through the Platform to transact privately to avoid the 1% fee.</li>
  <li>Any buyer who first discovers the property through the Platform shall be considered a Platform-introduced buyer, and the 1% fee shall apply to any transaction with such buyer within <strong>twelve (12) months</strong> from the date of first inquiry.</li>
</ol>

<h2>9. BREACH AND REMEDIES</h2>
