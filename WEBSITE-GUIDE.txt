--- HOW TO EDIT LISTINGS (Add/Remove Properties) ---

All listings are stored in ONE file: data/listings.js

Step 1: Go to https://github.com/cebulandmarket/cebulandmarket
Step 2: Click on "data" folder, then click "listings.js"
Step 3: Click the PENCIL ICON (top right of the file) to edit
Step 4: Add or edit a listing — each listing looks like this:

  {
    id: 17,
    title: "Your Property Title Here",
    location: "Barangay, City, Cebu",
    lot_area: "500 sqm",
    price_per_sqm: 5000,
    total_price: 2500000,
    classification: "Residential",
    title_status: "Clean Title",
    description: "Describe the property here.",
    photo_url: "images/your-photo.jpg",
    photo_urls: "images/photo1.jpg,images/photo2.jpg",
    status: "available"
  }

IMPORTANT: total_price = seller's BASE price (NO 1% fee added).
The website automatically adds the 1% when displaying to buyers.

Step 5: Scroll down, click "Commit changes"
Step 6: Wait ~1 minute, then check cebulandmarket.com/listings.html

Step 5: Click "Commit changes"
Step 6: Use the filename in listings.js like: "images/your-photo.jpg"


--- HOW TO EDIT ANY PAGE ---

Same as editing listings:
Step 1: Go to the GitHub repo
Step 2: Find the file you want to edit:
   - index.html      = Home page

   - about.html       = About page
   - faq.html         = FAQ page
   - privacy.html     = Privacy policy
Step 3: Click pencil icon, edit, commit


--- HOW TO MARK A PROPERTY AS SOLD ---

Step 1: Edit data/listings.js on GitHub
Step 2: Find the listing and change: status: "available" to status: "sold"
Step 3: Commit changes
Step 4: Collect the 1% platform fee via GCash
Step 5: Get proof of payment (GCash screenshot)
Step 6: Save documents to Google Drive (title, tax dec, seller ID, proof)


--- HOW TO DELETE A LISTING ---

Step 1: Edit data/listings.js on GitHub
Step 2: Delete the entire listing block (from { to })
Step 3: Make sure there are no extra commas left behind
Step 4: Commit changes
IMPORTANT: Never delete the photos from GitHub — keep them forever
