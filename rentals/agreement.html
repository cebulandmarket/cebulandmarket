        <h1>CONTRACT OF LEASE</h1>
        <p class="doc-subtitle">KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:</p>

        <p>This Contract of Lease made and entered into this <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> at Cebu City, Philippines, by and between:</p>

        <p><strong><span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span></strong>, Filipino of legal age, with address located at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, hereinafter referred to as the <strong>"LESSOR"</strong>;</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">&mdash; and &mdash;</p>

        <p><strong><span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span></strong>, <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span>, all of legal ages, with address located at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, hereinafter referred to as the <strong>"LESSEE"</strong>;</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:700; margin:24px 0;">WITNESSETH That:</p>

        <p>WHEREAS, the LESSOR is the true, lawful and registered owner of a <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span> located at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, Cebu.</p>

        <p>WHEREAS, the LESSEE desires to lease the said property, complete with all its furniture, appliances and fixtures, and the LESSOR is willing to let the same to the LESSEE, subject to the terms, conditions, stipulations and covenants set forth herein below;</p>

        <p>NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises and the conditions and stipulations hereinafter set forth, the LESSOR hereby leases unto the LESSEE the said property, including all fixtures therein and appurtenances thereto, (hereinafter referred to as the "Leased Properties") under the following terms and conditions:</p>

        <h2>OBLIGATIONS OF THE LESSEE</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h2>PROPERTIES SUBJECT OF THE LEASE</h2>
            <p>The Leased Properties consist of a <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, fully furnished with the list of furniture and fixtures particularly described in <strong>"Annex A"</strong>.</p>
            <p>The LESSEE represents and warrants that he has thoroughly inspected the leased properties and found the same to be in good order and condition.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>TERM OF LEASE</h2>
            <p>The lease shall be for a period of <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> to take effect on <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> &ndash; <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>.</p>
            <p>The LESSOR however expressly reserves the right to immediately pre-terminate the instant contract of lease, without the necessity of a court order, at any time before the expiration of the agreed term, for any violation of any of the terms and conditions of the instant contract.</p>
            <p>In case of pre-termination by the LESSEE which the parties agree will result to a loss of income and opportunity on the LESSOR's part, the security deposit given by the LESSEE shall be <strong>forfeited</strong> by way of damages.</p>
            <p>There will be no implied renewal of the lease as the parties agree that the contract is renewable only in writing at the sole option of the LESSOR, upon mutually agreeable terms and conditions. The LESSEE shall communicate in writing to the LESSOR its intention to renew the lease at least Thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of this Contract.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>RENTAL</h2>
            <p>The Parties agree that the rental of the Leased Premises shall be <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), Philippine currency, NET per month.</p>
            <p>The parties agree that the monthly rental shall be paid on or before its due date.</p>
            <p>The LESSEE shall therefore pay in <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> on or before <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> day of the corresponding month of the lease.</p>
            <p>Failure of the LESSEE to pay any of the monthly rentals on or before its due date shall be deemed as a gross violation of the contract; which shall be a ground for the termination of the same.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>ADVANCED RENTAL</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall pay an advance rental equivalent to <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> month(s) to the sum of <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), Philippine currency, upon signing of this agreement; which shall be applied to the <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> month of the term of the lease.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>SECURITY DEPOSIT</h2>
            <p>Upon signing of this contract, the LESSEE shall give the LESSOR <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> month(s) to the sum of <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), Philippine currency, as a Security Deposit ("Deposit") which shall serve as security for the full and faithful performance of every term provision, covenant and condition of this lease; such as but not limited to, the prompt payment of rentals, the payment of unpaid utilities at the expiration or termination of the lease and to answer for any damages caused to the leased premises not due to reasonable wear and tear. The LESSEE agrees that he shall not be allowed to offset or use its security deposit as its monthly rental payment.</p>
            <p>This amount is refundable After <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> Days upon Move-out to the LESSEE free of any interest after the termination of this Lease Agreement and after the leased premises have been completely vacated and surrendered by the LESSEE to the LESSOR subject however to deductions for repairs to restore the leased premises to the condition it was received and to whatever deductions for whatever utility bills, and interests, penalties and other obligations of the LESSEE that have remained unpaid, PROVIDED FURTHER, that the LESSEE shall still be liable for any and all bills, rentals, interests, penalties and damages that may exceed this security deposit.</p>
            <p>Moreover, In case of breach or violation by the LESSEE of any of the terms and conditions of the instant contract or in case of any pre-termination of the contract of lease by the LESSEE, the security deposit shall be <strong>automatically forfeited</strong> in favor of the Lessor, by way of liquidated damages, without need of court action or approval. In cases of such breach by the Lessee, the parties moreover agree that the deposit shall in no way relieve the LESSEE for any liability for any breach of the contract and other payments due to the LESSOR or for unpaid utilities; as in such cases, the Lessor shall, in addition to the forfeiture of the advanced rental and deposit in his favor, have the cause of action for damages, indemnity or for the payment of interests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>PENALTY</h2>
            <p>In case of default or delay in the payment of rentals for whatever reason, the LESSEE agrees to pay a penalty charge equivalent to <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> per cent per month which shall be computed on a cumulative basis, reckoned from its due date; without prejudice to the right of the LESSOR to terminate this contract and eject the LESSEE from the leased properties.</p>
            <p>This penalty charge shall likewise be applied to any charges billed to the LESSEE arising under this contract that are not paid within the payment period following billing herein established.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>UTILITIES</h2>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>USE OF LEASED PREMISES</h2>
            <p>During the term of this contract, the property shall be used by the LESSEE exclusively for his own and his family's residential purposes only. Illegal or immoral activities shall be prohibited; and regular occupants shall be limited to <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> persons. Multiple residents such as extended family or friends and the like shall not be allowed.</p>
            <p>The LESSEE shall be responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of all the occupants, his family members, servants and guests in respect to the use and occupancy of the Leased Premises and the observance of the conditions of this lease, as if the said acts and omissions were those of LESSEE himself.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>PROHIBITION AGAINST SUBLEASING</h2>

Consequently, the LESSEE is absolutely prohibited from advertising or offering the leased properties in AIR B &amp; B or any similar platform. Any violation of this provision would be deemed as a gross violation of the contract for which the contract may be immediately terminated at the option of the LESSOR, without prejudice to the forfeiture of the advanced rental and security deposit by way of liquidated damages.</p>
          </li>

          <li>

            <h2>SANITATION AND REPAIRS</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall keep and maintain the Leased Properties in good, clean and sanitary condition during the term of the Contract; and shall surrender the leased properties upon the expiration or termination of the lease, in the same condition when it was received, reasonable wear and tear accepted.</p>

            <p>It is understood that repairs costing <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> (P <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span>) or less, shall be considered minor and shall be for the account of the LESSEE.</p>
            <p>Repairs in excess of the above amount shall be treated as major repairs and shall be for the account of the LESSOR; provided however that the damage is not caused because of the fault or negligence of the LESSEE, his household, guests or employees.</p>
            <p>In case of major repairs, the LESSEE shall immediately notify the LESSOR of the nature of the repairs required and the LESSOR undertakes to repair the same within reasonable time.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>UNDERTAKING TO ABIDE BY THE LAW, ORDINANCES, ETC.</h2>
