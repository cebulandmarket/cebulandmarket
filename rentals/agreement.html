        <h1>CONTRACT OF LEASE</h1>
        <p class="doc-subtitle">KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS:</p>

        <p>This Contract of Lease is executed on <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> in Cebu City, Philippines, by and between:</p>

        <p><strong><span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span></strong>, of legal age, Filipino citizen, residing at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, hereinafter referred to as the <strong>"LESSOR"</strong>;</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">&mdash; and &mdash;</p>

        <p><strong><span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span></strong>, <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span>, of legal age, residing at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, hereinafter referred to as the <strong>"LESSEE"</strong>;</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:700; margin:24px 0;">WITNESSETH:</p>

        <p>WHEREAS, the LESSOR is the absolute and registered owner of a <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span> situated at <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, Cebu;</p>

        <p>WHEREAS, the LESSEE has expressed the desire to lease the aforementioned property, together with all furniture, appliances, and fixtures therein, and the LESSOR has agreed to lease the same under the terms, conditions, and covenants stated herein;</p>

        <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements set forth below, the LESSOR hereby leases to the LESSEE the said property, together with all fixtures and appurtenances (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Leased Premises"), subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>

        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h2>SUBJECT OF THE LEASE</h2>
            <p>The Leased Premises consist of a <span class="blank-long">&nbsp;</span>, fully furnished with the furniture and fixtures enumerated in <strong>"Annex A"</strong> attached hereto.</p>
            <p>The LESSEE acknowledges and confirms that he has conducted a thorough inspection of the Leased Premises and has found the same to be in satisfactory order and condition.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>DURATION OF LEASE</h2>
            <p>This lease shall be effective for a period of <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>, commencing on <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> and ending on <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>.</p>
            <p>The LESSOR retains the absolute right to immediately terminate this Contract, without need of judicial proceedings, at any time prior to the expiration of the agreed term, should the LESSEE violate any provision herein.</p>
            <p>Should the LESSEE elect to pre-terminate this lease, the parties acknowledge that such pre-termination shall cause the LESSOR loss of income and opportunity. Accordingly, the security deposit paid by the LESSEE shall be <strong>forfeited</strong> as liquidated damages.</p>
            <p>This lease shall not be deemed automatically renewed upon expiration. Renewal shall only be by written agreement, at the sole discretion of the LESSOR, under mutually acceptable terms. The LESSEE must provide written notice of intent to renew no later than Thirty (30) days before the expiration of this Contract.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>MONTHLY RENT</h2>
            <p>The monthly rent for the Leased Premises shall be <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), in Philippine currency, NET of all applicable charges.</p>
            <p>Rent shall be due and payable on or before the agreed date each month.</p>
            <p>Payment shall be made via <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> on or before the <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> day of each month throughout the lease period.</p>
            <p>Non-payment of any monthly rental by the due date shall constitute a material breach of this Contract and shall be sufficient ground for its termination.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>ADVANCE RENT</h2>
            <p>Upon execution of this Contract, the LESSEE shall pay advance rent equivalent to <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> month(s), amounting to <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), in Philippine currency. This advance shall be credited to the <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> month of the lease term.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>SECURITY DEPOSIT</h2>
            <p>Upon execution of this Contract, the LESSEE shall remit to the LESSOR a security deposit equivalent to <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> month(s), amounting to <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span> (Php <span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>), in Philippine currency ("Deposit"). This Deposit shall guarantee the LESSEE's faithful compliance with all obligations under this lease, including but not limited to timely payment of rent, settlement of utility charges upon lease expiration or termination, and indemnification for any damage to the Leased Premises beyond normal wear and tear. The LESSEE shall not apply or offset the Deposit against any monthly rental obligation.</p>
            <p>The Deposit shall be refundable, without interest, within <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> days after the LESSEE's move-out and after the Leased Premises have been fully vacated and surrendered to the LESSOR, subject to deductions for restoration of the property to its original condition, outstanding utility charges, accrued interest, penalties, and any other unpaid obligations of the LESSEE. Should such deductions exceed the Deposit, the LESSEE shall remain liable for any remaining balance.</p>
            <p>In the event the LESSEE breaches any provision of this Contract or pre-terminates the lease, the Deposit shall be <strong>automatically forfeited</strong> in favor of the LESSOR as liquidated damages, without need of judicial proceedings. Such forfeiture shall not release the LESSEE from liability for any outstanding obligations, unpaid rent, or utility charges. The LESSOR shall retain the right to pursue additional claims for damages, indemnification, or unpaid amounts beyond the forfeited Deposit and advance rent.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>LATE PAYMENT PENALTY</h2>
            <p>Should the LESSEE default on or delay payment of rent for any reason, a penalty of <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> percent per month shall be imposed, calculated cumulatively from the due date, without prejudice to the LESSOR's right to terminate this Contract and require the LESSEE to vacate the Leased Premises.</p>
            <p>The same penalty rate shall apply to any other charges or amounts due from the LESSEE under this Contract that remain unpaid beyond the prescribed payment period.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>UTILITY CHARGES</h2>
            <p>All utility expenses incurred during the lease term shall be borne by the LESSEE, including but not limited to water, electricity, telephone, Internet, cable television, air-conditioning maintenance, water tank and pressure system cleaning, and similar service charges.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>PERMITTED USE</h2>
            <p>The Leased Premises shall be used by the LESSEE solely for residential purposes for himself and his immediate family. No illegal or immoral activities shall be conducted within the premises. The maximum number of regular occupants shall not exceed <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> persons. Extended family members, friends, or other additional occupants shall not be permitted without the LESSOR's written consent.</p>
            <p>The LESSEE assumes full responsibility for all acts, omissions, and conduct of all occupants, household members, domestic helpers, and visitors with respect to the use and occupancy of the Leased Premises, as though such acts were those of the LESSEE.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>NO SUBLEASING</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE is strictly prohibited from subleasing, assigning, or transferring occupancy of any portion of the Leased Premises to any third party, whether through formal agreement or informal arrangement, without the LESSOR's prior written approval. The LESSEE is likewise prohibited from listing or advertising the Leased Premises on Airbnb or any similar short-term rental platform. Any breach of this provision shall constitute a material violation of this Contract, entitling the LESSOR to immediately terminate the lease and forfeit the advance rent and security deposit as liquidated damages.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
            <p>No structural modifications, alterations, or improvements shall be made to the Leased Premises without the LESSOR's prior written approval. Any permanent improvements or alterations that cannot be removed without causing damage or defacement to the property shall automatically become the LESSOR's property upon termination of this Contract, with no obligation to reimburse the LESSEE.</p>
            <p>Painting, drilling holes, and any modifications to the electrical or plumbing systems are prohibited without the LESSOR's prior written approval.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall maintain the Leased Premises in a clean, sanitary, and good condition throughout the lease term. Upon termination or expiration, the LESSEE shall return the property in the same condition as when received, with allowance for normal wear and tear.</p>
            <p>Regular upkeep of appliances and electronics, including quarterly servicing of air-conditioning units by a qualified technician, shall be at the LESSEE's expense.</p>
            <p>Repairs costing <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span> (P <span class="blank-short">&nbsp;</span>) or below shall be classified as minor repairs and shall be borne by the LESSEE.</p>
            <p>Repairs exceeding the above threshold shall be classified as major repairs and shall be the LESSOR's responsibility, provided the damage was not caused by the LESSEE's fault, negligence, or that of his household, guests, or employees.</p>
            <p>For major repairs, the LESSEE shall promptly inform the LESSOR of the nature of the damage, and the LESSOR shall undertake the necessary repairs within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>RULES AND REGULATIONS</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall observe and comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the building management and the homeowner's association, which the LESSEE acknowledges having been informed of prior to entering into this lease.</p>
            <p>Smoking inside the Leased Premises is strictly prohibited. No furniture, appliances, or equipment belonging to the LESSOR shall be removed from the property without the LESSOR's written permission.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall not store or keep any flammable, combustible, or explosive substances within the Leased Premises, as such storage would be in violation of applicable fire insurance policies. Should this provision be violated, the LESSOR may immediately terminate this Contract, and the LESSEE shall be held fully liable for all resulting damages, without prejudice to any other legal remedies available to the LESSOR.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>LEGAL COMPLIANCE</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall observe and comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and licensing or permit requirements pertaining to the use, occupancy, and sanitation of the Leased Premises. Any failure to comply shall be entirely at the LESSEE's risk, cost, and liability, and the LESSOR shall be held harmless from any consequences thereof. The LESSEE shall indemnify the LESSOR against any fines, claims, demands, or legal actions of any nature brought by any authority, entity, or person resulting from the LESSEE's non-compliance.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>LIABILITY FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE</h2>
            <p>The LESSEE shall bear full responsibility for repairing any damage to the Leased Premises, including all furniture, fixtures, and appliances, that results from or is attributable to the willful or negligent acts of the LESSEE, members of his household, guests, or employees.</p>
            <p>Should any furniture or fixture listed in "Annex A" be lost or damaged, the LESSEE shall compensate the LESSOR based on the item's <strong>current replacement value</strong>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>RIGHT OF INSPECTION</h2>

            <h2>DEFAULT, LESSOR'S LIEN, AND POWER OF ATTORNEY</h2>
            <p>All covenants and agreements contained herein are deemed essential conditions of this lease. Any default or violation shall entitle the LESSOR to terminate this Contract, re-enter the Leased Premises, and without need of demand or judicial action, expel the LESSEE or secure the premises, including any of the LESSEE's belongings found therein. The LESSEE hereby expressly consents to and authorizes the LESSOR to take all reasonable measures necessary to disconnect utilities and secure the premises. No such action by the LESSOR or its representatives shall be deemed trespass or give rise to any legal claim by the LESSEE.</p>
            <p>Upon exercising the right to retake possession, the LESSOR may transfer any of the LESSEE's belongings found in the Leased Premises to any available storage space under the LESSOR's control, and may charge the LESSEE reasonable storage fees not exceeding the monthly rent for the Leased Premises.</p>
            <p>If eviction becomes necessary, or if the LESSEE fails to settle all outstanding obligations within fifteen (15) days from the date of expiration, termination, or eviction, the LESSOR is hereby irrevocably appointed as the LESSEE's <strong>SPECIAL ATTORNEY-IN-FACT</strong>, with full authority to sell, dispose of, or retain any or all of the LESSEE's goods, furniture, equipment, supplies, and other property found in the premises, in such amounts as may be sufficient to satisfy all arrears, unpaid obligations, removal costs, transportation, handling, and other related expenses, all of which shall be charged to the LESSEE.</p>
            <p>This Special Power of Attorney shall remain in effect for as long as the LESSEE has any unpaid obligation under this Contract. It is an integral part of this agreement, and the LESSEE hereby ratifies and confirms all actions taken by the LESSOR in the exercise of this authority.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>SURRENDER OF PREMISES</h2>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>WAIVER</h2>
            <p>The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Contract on a particular occasion shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision in future instances.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>CUMULATIVE REMEDIES</h2>
            <p>No delay or failure by the LESSOR in exercising any right or remedy under this Contract shall operate as a waiver thereof. No partial exercise of any right shall preclude the further exercise of that or any other right. All remedies available to the LESSOR under this Contract are cumulative and are in addition to any remedies available under applicable law.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
            <p>Should any provision of this Contract be declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The parties' rights and obligations shall be interpreted as though the invalid provision were not included in this Contract.</p>
